Technical Overview
==================

MindMira is built using Python and leverages a modular architecture for scalability and maintainability.

Core Components
---------------

1. **Chatbot Engine**:
   - Processes user inputs and generates responses.
   - Built with natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

2. **Emotion Analysis Module**:
   - Analyzes user responses to detect emotional states.
   - Uses sentiment analysis libraries such as `TextBlob` or `NLTK`.

3. **Conversation Flow**:
   - Guides the user through predefined flows for emotional support.
   - Can be expanded with custom conversation templates.

4. **Configuration Settings**:
   - All settings, such as response templates and language preferences, are stored in `config.json`.

Technologies Used
-----------------

- **Python**: Core programming language for development.
- **NLTK/TextBlob**: Libraries for NLP and sentiment analysis.
- **Flask (Optional)**: For web-based chatbot deployment.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for storing user sessions and logs.

Future Enhancements
-------------------

- Integration with more advanced NLP models like GPT.
- Deployment as a web application using Flask or Django.
- Real-time analytics dashboard for tracking user interaction trends.
